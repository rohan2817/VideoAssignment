1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,819
If you don't do it nothing is possible. If you try to do it at least you have the hope. You

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:14,969
had that third failure in a row did you think I need [to] pack this in better?

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:23,980
Why not? I don't ever give up. I mean I'd have to be dead or completely incapacitated. So

4
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:34,659
many things go wrong when you're starting a company and often I think people ask you know, what mistakes

5
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:36,829
should you avoid making. And

6
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:42,729
you know my answer the question is don't even bother trying to avoid mistakes because you're going to make tons of mistakes right. And

7
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:48,429
the the important thing is actually learning quickly from whatever mistakes you make and not giving up.

8
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:54,369
Right and I mean there are things every single year of Facebook's existence that could have killed us are made it so that.

9
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,879
It just seemed like moving forward and making a lot of progress just seemed intractable

10
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,789
but you just kind of bounce back and you learn. And

11
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:05,409
nothing is impossible. You just have to kind of keep running through the walls.

12
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:10,119
It's hard changing your life.

13
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:17,349
It was hard when just over three years ago and the penobscot building in Detroit, Michigan. Where

14
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:25,238
I was operating my business, and I fell on some hard times, and I was sleeping in my office.

15
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,160
It was hard coming into the lobby and the security said: Excuse me, Mr.

16
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,389
Brown, can we see you for a moment? And I said yes, and I walked up to the counter

17
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,550
and he gave me an envelope. And

18
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:44,020
he said: Would you mind reading it here" and I opened the envelope and the envelope was from management that says this is

19
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,369
an office tower

20
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:48,369
it's not a hotel.

21
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,970
Please.

22
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,970
Do not sleep in your office.

23
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:56,139
And I said excuse me, sir. I said, I just worked long hours in

24
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,289
creating my business. I'm an entrepreneur. And

25
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,660
right now things are bad for me, but they're not going to be this way always.

26
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,950
and

27
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:13,599
I just asked for the opportunity to continue to operate like I'm doing. I'm not trying to make this my home and

28
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,269
it was hard coming through the lobby and

29
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,920
sometimes they would laugh. There's a guy talking about becoming successful and look at him

30
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:27,069
he's bathing in the bathroom upstairs on the 21st floor he sleeps on the floor.

31
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,810
him into other dreamers up there, look at him!

32
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:35,699
It was hard, ladies and gentleman coming to speak to people. And

33
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,149
I was facing financial difficulties in my own life.

34
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,610
I was behind on my bills and my dreams and I'm saying to them you can live your dream.

35
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:51,299
It was hardly ladies and gentlemen, it was very difficult to pick myself up each day believing.

36
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,090
But I can do it there was times that I doubted myself. I think God, why,  why is it happening to me?

37
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:03,239
I'm just trying to take care of my children and my mother. I'm not trying to steal a rod from anybody. I

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
just have to happen to me.

39
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:09,209
It was very hard.

40
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,639
Here's what I want to say to you.

41
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:14,849
For those of you that have experienced some hardships.

42
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Don't give up on your dream.

43
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:20,669
No, one could have convinced me by holding off.

44
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:26,669
By continuing to push forward, by continuing to run toward my dream.

45
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:29,849
And one day I

46
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,010
would have my own talk show.

47
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:36,989
It's a long shot, ladies and gentlemen from liberty fitted an abandoned building auto flow.

48
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,660
Now we're knowing my mother father.

49
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:45,899
It's a long shot being here with you today in this goal in Atlantic the long shot.

50
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:51,869
No, college training labeled, educable mentally retarded, but I kept running toward my dream.

51
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,129
You tried to get into three colleges.

52
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,899
Each time they rejected.  You know I tried there's a

53
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,690
examination that young people if you want to go university of the taste take the examinations.

54
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:17,600
So I threw three times a lot of food. I feel for funny things that I fooled, a key,

55
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,290
primary school tests for two times and I failed

56
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,839
like a three times for the Middle school, middle schools. And

57
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,979
You would never believe in, in Jansel, my city there is only one Middle school.

58
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:43,760
That lasts only one year, it was changed from primary school, Middle school because our graduates of ours our, our school.

59
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,329
No, universe, you know middle school except us because we were too bad.

60
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,330
What effect did it have the

61
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,760
being rejected?

62
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,340
Well, I think we have to get used to it. We're not that good even today.

63
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,940
We still have a lot of people reject us. I think God

64
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,450
when I in the

65
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,469
graduate from Universities and before you know for three years.

66
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:15,019
I tried so in the university to apply jobs, or 30 times got rejected.

67
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,619
I went for a police if you know you're not good. I went to look even the

68
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,679
KFC. When KFC came to check a blog they

69
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,780
see
24 people went for the job.

70
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,709
23 people accepted I was only a guy. And

71
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,450
we went for please five people all of them accepted.

72
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:43,809
I was the only guy that I receive it. So for me being turned down, rejected out by the way

73
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,920
I told you that I was I apply for Harvard for ten times rejected.

74
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,209
Nothing works the first time when you try something new it probably won't work.

75
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:58,180
When you try something new several times it probably won't work and the turning point in my life came when I would hear good ideas

76
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,310
and I was so eager to be successful in selling. I would run out and try the ideas and they wouldn't work. I try a

77
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,760
way of getting an appointment or answering an objection or closing a sale it wouldn't work. And my natural response ah and

78
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,459
I think yes to be disappointed and then I realized nothing works at least the first few times.

79
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,400
So I decided I would try a new idea five or ten times before I pass judgment on. I would not just try it once
and quit like most people do and that changed my whole life.

80
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,819
It was a turning point of my life because I realized from then on if you've got a good idea.

81
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,449
And you've got a good goal, and you want to double your income and improve the quality of your life.

82
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,390
And you have to try new things in order to get new results.

83
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,460
It's not going to work the first time to say well that didn't work try something else and try something else and try something else.

84
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,340
Now if you try only two things can happen, what are they?

85
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,989
Succeed or fail. If you succeed you do more of it if you fail

86
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,920
you learn from it. Get smarter and try it again. So you cannot lose by taking action you can only lose by not taking actions.

87
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,749
Practice faithful persisting means never ever ever give up.

88
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,910
Chicken soup for the soul was rejected by a hundred and forty four publishers.

89
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:10,359
144 Publisher said we don't want to publish a collection short story. The title stupid chicken soup for the soul.

90
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
What does that mean people don't buy?

91
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,269
Collections of short stories, there's never been you know successful

92
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,070
chain of doing that. So literally we spent 14 months,

93
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:27,100
trying to find a publisher and we go to New York with our agent eventually our agent gave us the book.

94
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:32,869
And said I can't sell it. So we went to the national booksellers association convention down in Anaheim.

95
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,800
We went from booth to booth to booth for three days, and there were 4,000 publishers represented there there we go.

96
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,659
Would you publish a book? Would you publish a book? Would you publish your book? And we got no no no no no. It was

97
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:50,660
late on the third day that a little publisher from Florida after we'd gotten over 144 rejections said we'll read it. And

98
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,890
then they said we said well, how many copies do you think we'll sell? After they said yeah?

99
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:59,509
We'll buy it a couple weeks later. So we'll publish it and we said well. Maybe 20,000 if we're lucky.

100
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,229
And we said with our goals to sell a million and a half in a year now.

101
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,279
Now have you ever told someone your dream and had them laugh out loud at you.

102
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,730
He laughed out loud.

103
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,950
Now if we had given up after a hundred publishers had said no, I wouldn't be standing here today.

104
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,090
You know wouldn't it happen and so you've got to be willing to persevere.

105
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:27,350
Because we didn't take no. See when the world says no you say next. Let's practice that if I say no, you say: Yes!

106
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:35,750
Absolutely, there's only five or six billion people out there you can go and ask.There's over 4,000 publishers just here in the state of

107
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,129
California. So what we have is endless possibility, but you have to persevere.

108
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,449
It's as if the universe tests our commitment and so today we have

109
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,289
147 titles in Print we sold over 115 million copies.

110
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:54,230
We're in 47 languages and over a billion dollars where the chickens lose control if you've been sober a life.

111
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,219
So if you're willing to decide what you want believe, it's possible.

112
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,810
Consciously envision the future.
Feel the feelings of what it would feel like if you'd achieve this goal.

113
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:11,599
You can have anything and then you take action both obvious actions and inspired actions you can do anything.

114
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,420
There's no such thing as failure.

115
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,069
Failure is an idea because success is also a stupid idea.

116
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,840
Success and failure is not in the volumes of money flowing into your life.

117
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:35,549
Success and failure is not dependent upon the recognition that you're finding in the world.

118
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:44,429
You're successful with life if you know how to walk with joy, to help.

119
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,309
The first and foremost, success is

120
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,449
that you are not a slave to anybody's idea.

121
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,540
Don't become a slave to somebody's idea.

122
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
At least have your own idea.

123
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,759
Every idea, every part, every emotion ,every value that you have

124
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,959
is picked up from somewhere  and it rules you from within.

125
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,170
It rules you from within.

126
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,479
Your religion, your society, your

127
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,949
culture has trained you to believe. That this is it.
